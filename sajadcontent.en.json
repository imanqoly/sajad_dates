      "text": "Sajad Dates is a brand built on over half a century of passion, expertise, and generational continuity—a story of a family rooted in the scorching yet fertile palm groves of Bam, who, since the 1940s, have intertwined their lives with the date palm. \n The founder of the Sajjadi family, relying on local knowledge, respect for the land, and a belief in quality, planted a seed that grew into a towering presence in Iran’s date industry. \nIn the following decades, the second generation expanded the family groves, improved harvesting and storage methods, and took the first steps toward packaging and export—marking Sajad’s entry into international markets. \nTragically, this generation, who were the pillars of the brand’s growth and industrialization, perished in the devastating Bam earthquake. \nYet the loss became a source of inspiration, not an end. Today, Sajad continues stronger than ever, rooted in that legacy. \nThe third generation ushered in a new era with advanced processing units, international certifications, a modern brand identity, and an export development team—paving the way for full entry into global markets. \nNow, Sajjad Dates stands as a leading exporter of Iranian Mazafati dates, with customers across Europe, Asia, Canada, and the Middle East. With a lasting commitment to quality, sustainability, and customer satisfaction, we remain proudly rooted while moving boldly toward the future. Sajjad is a story of generational continuity, enduring quality, and a global vision for an authentic Iranian product."
